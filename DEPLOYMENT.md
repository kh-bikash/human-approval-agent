# Deployment

## Local product

Install with `python -m pip install -e .`, then run the command shown in README. The browser binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default. `GET /healthz` is a lightweight health endpoint.

## Container

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, replace every example secret, and keep that file outside Git. Build and run from this repository:

```bash
docker build -t human-approval-agent .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 --env-file .env -v approval_data:/data human-approval-agent --db /data/approvals.sqlite3 --outdir /data/approved serve --port 8080
```

The image runs as a non-root user. It binds inside the container to `0.0.0.0`; the example publishes only to host loopback. A non-loopback bind requires `AGENT_WEB_TOKEN` of at least 16 characters. The browser asks for that token and sends it to the action endpoint. Put TLS and an authenticated reverse proxy in front of any public deployment.

Back up approval_data and limit access to reviewers. The browser supports only the scoped write-file action; all changes are audited in SQLite.

## Release checks

Run `ruff check src tests`, `ruff format --check src tests`, and `pytest -q`. Test the browser action path and `/healthz` after deployment. Keep secrets in the deployment platform, monitor failed actions and model/provider errors, and set backups for any mounted data volume.
